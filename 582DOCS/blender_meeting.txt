micahscopes You should not need to run cmake again, that this happens hints that the library using dna_type_offsets.h isn't listing bf_dna
as a dep. or this wouldn't have happened.
19:36
Well the weird thing is that
add_dependencies(bf_blenkernel bf_dna)
was already in CMakeLists.txt
(Thanks for helping me understand this by the way)
19:37
That's odd then, as this means
dna_type_offsets.h
should be created. If there is a reproducable bug, it can be investigated.

How do I go back in version ? the current one that I built is 2.91.0 , I want to go back to 2.90.0 (2020-08-31) , how do I do it ? , When I do
git branch -a I get branches but by feature name , like remotes/origin/layers or remotes/origin/hair_guides
,
But nothing about versions ?
23:30
Soutrik You are looking for a
tag not a branch üôÇ git tag to list all then tags and the check one out using git checkout <tag>
üôÇ
23:30
I see , thank you
00:23
ideasman42 I've just seen your commit about the deprecation of of
bpy.app.binary_path_python. I've checked and sys.executable returns None
in my developer debug build, so currently this doesn't seem like we can replace it just yet.
Release build seems to be fine.
00:24
Robert G√ºtzkow
bpy.app.binary_path_python is an alias to sys.executable
now, are you sure about this?
00:25
Yes, in my build from 25 min. ago
bpy.app.binary_path_python returns the path, but sys.executable returns None
00:27
Does blender print this on startup
Unable to find the python binary, the multiprocessing module may not be functional!
?
00:27
Oops, yes it does.
00:28
Then
binary_path_python should be None too, try update again (check you have 276d19f63b4534545c2e1a9d5c48525298b1a445
), fixed this recently
00:29
Yes I have, just pulled and build today
00:30
That doesn't make sense then, this just returns
sys.executable
.
00:30
I'll investigate later
Gotta go for now.
00:43
iss Hey! From my understanding you did get the automated sequencer test in master. That's cool! I would suggest the following now:
- Add animated transform test
- Verify the media transform patch passes all tests
- Commit the media transform patch
- Profit
00:44
arc doesn't seem to accept connection today... tried on two of my computers, it always time out, any ideas?
00:44
Sergey Tests are in, but I think I screwed up - now LTS and few other tests are failing for some reason on buildbot. Not sure how to debug this
00:45
why would LTS care üòï
LTS is failing due to BLI_path_test
00:48
Ah, I am just checking. But master is failing because of my test. Locally it's OK
00:48
testing sequencer test locally here
00:49
Good morning
00:49
I was thinking perhaps buildbot didn't checkout SVN?
dr. Sybren Hi
00:51
iss no, files are there
iss now, while it compiles. how about an educated guess?
iss absolute paths?
00:53
that could be the case...
00:53
yeah.....

(also to see if it is still worth to have alternate meeting times, instead of a single one)
02:13
dfelinto Brecht What's your opinion on recognisability of people? Personally I notice that I'm getting a bit annoyed by having to know who has what name on which system. Mostly because my memory isn't that good, so it's mostly annoyance with myself. From an outsider's point of view, it's also nice to be able to recognise people and know they're the same ones in various Blender-communication-platforms.
Note that I'm not arguing for forcing people to use their real name. Just a consistent name everywhere, in all the communications.

dr. Sybren I have something to say about that, but need to finish meeting notes first

02:18
there's two parts to this. one is we need an official webpage with list of contributors

    we could have some recommendations on naming

Brecht I can write a proposal on devtalk?
02:29
dr. Sybren there is also the topic of using blender id badges on phabricator
dr. Sybren all in all I think people should use real names in the official blender channels + official filliations
(whether that means to show that someone is a blender developer with commit access, or to show that someone is from e.g., ubisoft, nvidia, ..)
it has to be done well so it not used to favour one report over the other for instance
but knowing who we are talking to goes a long way
dr. Sybren Ton had some ideas/requirements for that. you may want to check with him
I was personally waiting for James (new devops/operations) to arrive, and after CI, to revisit this topic
dr. Sybren meanwhile what I did was to use my wiki as my ID hub: wiki.blender.org/wiki/User:Dfelinto (inspired by jesterKing 's ideas on that)
02:35
And in the mean time the Modules wiki page is pointing to people's projects on dev.b.o instead

Sergey I found issue with transform patch when using proxies, so I will fix that first.
But yesterday I was using
arc land
to commit and I noticed it doesn't use my git credentials, do I need to configure this somehow?
02:48
pablovazquez (cc ideasman42 Hans Goudey ) check the great new artworks Daniel Bystedt added to wiki.blender.org/wiki/Reference/Release_Notes/2.91/Modeling

    üëç 1 ü§© 1 

and I just moved the add object tool to 2.92 release page
02:51
I'd like to come to some resolution for developer.blender.org/T81452
I think people with strong opinions on the matter have commented (including myself), AFAICS we agree to disagree on some of the issues which happens at times. Nevertheless, some way to move on is needed.
02:54
dfelinto Sebastian Parborg Just wondering, should .mkv videos be used in the Wiki? I am not able to play them in my browser

    üëç 1 

e.g. the chain video from wiki.blender.org/wiki/Reference/Release_Notes/2.91/Physics
02:55
iss
arc land
got broken with some of the tweaks. Or, maybe it is expected new behavior actually. Brecht should know better, AFAIR that tweak came from him
02:57
I may be using quite old version as well though...
03:00
sebbas I can play them in both firefox and chrome
03:00
Safari is a bit bad
doesn't support webm either..
03:02

03:08
Brecht question about 7 years old code, so I can imagine you don't remember üòâ
In
solve_parenting() (object.c), there are two very similarly-named variables, float totmat[4][4]; and float tmat[4][4];
. Do you have any idea what they are?
03:10
sebbas then I guess it is a mac issue üòâ
03:10
Bastien is there a good reason thumbnails are always written LARGE? (even when regular Thumbnails are displayed).
(made a small patch to change this, but you might know off hand why it's this way - D9412)
03:11
Sebastian Parborg in the end it's our issue ...
03:11
sebbas or hmm, saw the firefox report, I guess it is because I compile firefox myself üòõ
So I guess there is some fixes in gentoo that makes it work
Anyways, I can easily reencode it to mp4
03:12
right, you compile everything üôÇ
03:13
(Or just copy it to a new container in this case)

    üëç 1 

03:13
dr. Sybren I don't know the reason for those names, but isn't it clear from how they are computed?
totmat is the parent's object matrix, tmat is totmat * parent inverse matrix
Sergey iss maybe something needs to be fixed for arc land. the intent was to use the developer.blender.org username if no email address is there
03:17
Brecht The problem is that something is going wrong. This means I can't safely assume the semantics of the variables from the implementation, because the implementation might be wrong.
03:17
Brecht I have email defined in phabricator, Will look into this later.
03:19
ideasman42 not sure what you mean? how would you know in advance what size of thumbnails people want to display?
03:19
Currently the file selector has a zoom level you can use to display thumbnails
the thumbnail cache can generate normal or large thumbnails.
So. we could not generate large thumbnails if the user doesn't have the view set to large.
03:21
yes... but then you need to re-generate those thumbnails if user switch to large preview...
03:21
right
Another patch proposed to make all Blender thumbnails 256x256 internally, because they're scaled up to 256 anyway, which made me wonder why they are scaled up when I wasn't viewing them at that size, and we support non-large thumbnails.
03:22
because it's cheaper/simpler to just generate and store one size?
03:22
(other patch developer.blender.org/D9404 )
03:22
like, is there a real reason not to do so?
03:23
4x the size, precious hard disk space? ... I don't have a strong opinion on this though. It just struck me as strange.
Code comments could explain why large thumbnails are always used no matter what.
03:24
256x256 remains ridiculous in term of disk space given modern disks, come one
03:25
Yep, it's fine, but nice if comments explain that... since reading code it's not clear why we would multi-sized thumbs but not use it.
03:25
Well, was kinda obvious for me, but sure, can add a comment
03:26
I thought this might have been the reason, but it wasn't
obvious
03:28
Talking about non-obvious things... where does
BKE_object_where_is_calc_ex()
store its result?
I'm guessing
ob->obmat
, but it doesn't seem to be written down anywhere.
03:31
dr. Sybren
BKE_object_to_mat4(ob, ob->obmat)
?
and then constraints also affect that value
(and rigid bodies)
03:31
Sergey I had to look for
SpaceSeq
to fix versioning with proxies. If you want to check this change, here is paste P1746. Otherwise I can commit
03:32
dr. Sybren or are you complaining about our usual lack of code doc/comments? üòâ
03:32
Bastien I am, especially since there actually is a return parameter that can hold a matrix.
03:33
dr. Sybren well, now you know what to do today üòõ
03:33
Bastien yeah, fix a bug in the parenting code, between all the
tmat, totmat
, and functions that don't say what they do.
Not to mention the
locmat that doesn't just store the loc
03:34
dr. Sybren so now it's "learn and document functions, then fix the bug"
locmat == local_matrix
, welcome to old bad naming habits ...
03:34
it's horrible
03:34
just go fix it!
03:35
loc = location, mat == material, locmat == location_of_material
, everybody knows that.

04:00
Soutrik blender 2.91 isn't tagged yet. They get tag when finally released. I recommend using

05:25
Germano Do you think that clamping to zero for the fbx import would be a viable workaround or would you handle this differently?
05:26
iss not immediatelly clear why proxies need special handling. is it because ImBuf's dimensions are used for do-versions?
05:27
Sergey yes, it uses imBuf dimensions.

05:29
Robert G√ºtzkow, probably. But the ideal would be to find out why some exporters set negative values for shininess.
(btw, Bastien who maintains that exporter).

05:31
Miro Horvath That may be my fault. If you give me some time I can look into it
05:31
The last time I asked Bastien about strange output from fbx exporters, he was equally surprised by the nonsense they produced. Since there is not public specification, it's a bit difficult to check what should or shouldn't work.
05:32
just use gltf...
05:33
Bastien It's about a bug report though. Can't really tell our users to just switch to a different format? developer.blender.org/T75169
05:35
Robert G√ºtzkow just close as invalid, unless someone can prove us this is a valid value in FBX specs - which I doubt to ever see demonstrated...
05:39
Hans Goudey sure, no problem
05:39
Bastien Done.
05:44

    ok thanks then,.. I'm new to building Blender so words like GCC doesn't ring a bell in the instant moment ... 

Miro Horvath In that case, welcome üôÇ

Hans Goudey Hi, do you remember the problem with the Strength brush icon? we have again the same issue
06:00
Clipboard - 2 de noviembre de 2020 15:00
06:01
Hans Goudey Left is 2.83, right 2.92
the icon missed alpha
06:01
Ton While looking for the root cause of a bug Bassam Kurdali found, I went all the way back to the very first commit.
The context: when parenting an object, the parent-inverse matrix is computed to make it possible to parent without moving the object.
The problem: that computation also includes the effect of constraints. This means that the rotation of a Copy Rotation constraint now acts as the rotation of a parent. This causes the child object's local translation to be rotated as well.
Do you have any idea why it was done this way? Why the effects of constraints are also applied when computing the parent-inverse matrix?
06:08
Antonioya Hmm, thanks, I'll look into it
06:12
Hans Goudey np, and thanks to give you work?? üòâ
06:13
iss is probably fine then. can't spot anything obviously bad/wrong in your patch.
but i'm a bit pre-occupied with other task, so commit with care üòâ (not sure it is aimed for commit today?)
06:14
Sergey Ok, I would like to commit today, unless you want more time to review
06:47
iss The test
sequencer_render_transform
is failing on my machine. Could this have anything to do with local build options?
06:52
dr. Sybren Originally I had absolute paths in test files but I fixed them. So make sure you have latest files
06:53
iss the report HTML is really weird. It shows stripes instead of images, unless I hover my mouse over them, then they do show images.
06:53
Clipboard - November 2, 2020 3:53 PM
06:53
I don't know if that's caused by absolute paths.
I'll
svn up
and re-test
06:54
my fix was rBL62509
But it's strange I don't see ref images?
06:55
I just did a
make update
, rebuilding & re-running the test now
there we go, now they succeed, thanks!
I was just doing some things with parenting & transforms, so I wanted to be sure this wasn't caused by me
"

Yes, when I added those links I checked each person and tried pointing to the most appropriate place.
07:22
PhilippOeser please be more strict in which bug reports get confirmed. developer.blender.org/T82309 has an example file with multiple windows, lots of animation data & NLA strips that may or may not be relevant, and I think it can be stripped down way further than it is now.
